HTML - HyperText Markup Language - the standard markup language used to create web pages.

CSS - Cascading Style Sheets - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.

DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree

HTML uses tags to define the content and structure of the page.  The style of the page is defined by CSS.

All webpages are broken into boxes.  Where you put the boxes is the makeup for the tree that you will create.

In CSS you first write a selector - selector can be an element or a class or other.  p or div or .description (class selectors start with . )

Semantic Elements - are more specific than basic elements - example <h1> is semantic where <div> is not.
